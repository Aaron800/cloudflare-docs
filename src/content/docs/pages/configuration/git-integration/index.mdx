Cloudflare supports connecting Cloudflare Pages to your [GitHub](/pages/configuration/git-integration/github-integration) and [GitLab](/pages/configuration/git-integration/gitlab-integration) repositories, and will automatically deploy your code everytime you push a change to a branch.

Using Git integration with Cloudflare also provides:

- **Preview deployments for custom branches**, generating preview URLs for a commit to any branch in the repository without affecting your production deployment.
- **Preview URLs in pull requests** (PRs) to the repository.
- **Build and deployment status checks** within the Git repository.
- **Skipping builds using a commit message**.

These features allow you to manage your deployments directly within GitHub or GitLab without leaving your team's regular development workflow.

## Supported Git Providers

Cloudflare Pages supports the following Git providers:

- GitHub

  - [GitHub Free](https://github.com/pricing)
  - [GitHub Team](https://github.com/pricing)
  - [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://github.com/pricing)

- GitLab
  - [GitLab Free](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  - [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  - [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  - [GitLab Enterprise](https://about.gitlab.com/enterprise/)

If you use [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server), [Self-Managed GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/), or another Git provider (e.g., Bitbucket), you can:

- Start with a Direct Upload project and deploy using a [CI/CD provider with Wrangler CLI](/pages/how-to/use-direct-upload-with-continuous-integration/).
- Or, [disable automatic deployments](/pages/configuration/git-integration/#disable-automatic-deployments) in a Git-integrated project and use a [CI/CD provider with Wrangler CLI](/pages/how-to/use-direct-upload-with-continuous-integration/).

## Adding Git Integration

If you don't have a Git account linked to your Cloudflare account, you'll be prompted to set up an installation to GitHub or GitLab when [connecting to Git](/pages/get-started/git-integration/) for the first time, or when adding a new Git account. Follow the prompts and authorize the Cloudflare Git integration.

You can check the following pages to see if your Git integration has been installed:

- [GitHub Applications page](https://github.com/settings/installations) (if you're in an organization, select **Switch settings context** to access your GitHub organization settings)
- [GitLab Authorized Applications page](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications)

For details on providing access to organization accounts, see the [GitHub](/pages/configuration/git-integration/github-integration/#organizational-access) and [GitLab](/pages/configuration/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#organizational-access) guides.

## Managing Git Integration

You can manage the Git installation associated with your repository connection by navigating to the Pages project, then going to **Settings** > **Builds** and selecting **Manage** under **Git Repository**.

This can be useful for managing repository access or troubleshooting installation issues by reinstalling. For more details, see the [GitHub](/pages/configuration/git-integration/github-integration/#managing-access) and [GitLab](/pages/configuration/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#managing-access) guides.

## Disable Automatic Deployments

If you are using a Git-integrated project and do not want to trigger deployments every time you push a commit, you can use [branch control](/pages/configuration/branch-build-controls/) to disable/pause builds:

1. Go to the **Settings** of your **Pages project** in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Navigate to **Build** > edit **Branch control** > turn off **Enable automatic production branch deployments**.
3. You can also change your Preview branch to **None (Disable automatic branch deployments)** to pause automatic preview deployments.

Then, you can use Wrangler to deploy directly to your Pages project and make changes to your Git repository without automatically triggering a build.

## Troubleshooting

If your git integration is experiencing issues, you may find the following banners in the Deployment page of your Pages project.

### Project Creation

#### `This repository is being used for a Cloudflare Pages project on a different Cloudflare account.`

Using the same GitHub/GitLab repository across separate Cloudflare accounts is disallowed. To use the repository for a Pages project in that Cloudflare account, you should delete any Pages projects using the repository in other Cloudflare accounts.

### Deployments

If you run into any issues related to deployments or failing, check your project dashboard to see if there are any SCM installation warnings listed as shown in the screenshot below.

To resolve any errors displayed in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, follow the steps listed below.

#### `This project is disconnected from your Git account, this may cause deployments to fail.`

To resolve this issue, follow the steps provided above in the [Reinstalling a Git installation section](/pages/configuration/git-integration/#reinstall-a-git-installation) for the applicable SCM provider. If the issue persists even after uninstalling and reinstalling, contact support.

#### `Cloudflare Pages is not properly installed on your Git account, this may cause deployments to fail.`

To resolve this issue, follow the steps provided above in the [Reinstalling a Git installation section](/pages/configuration/git-integration/#reinstall-a-git-installation) for the applicable SCM provider. If the issue persists even after uninstalling and reinstalling, contact support.

#### `The Cloudflare Pages installation has been suspended, this may cause deployments to fail.`

Go to your GitHub installation settings:

- `https://github.com/settings/installations` for individual accounts
- `https://github.com/organizations/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME>/settings/installations` for organizational accounts

Click **Configure** on the Cloudflare Pages application. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Unsuspend** to allow Cloudflare Pages to make future deployments.

#### `The project is linked to a repository that no longer exists, this may cause deployments to fail.`

You may have deleted or transferred the repository associated with this Cloudflare Pages project. For a deleted repository, you will need to create a new Cloudflare Pages project with a repository that has not been deleted. For a transferred repository, you can either transfer the repository back to the original Git account or you will need to create a new Cloudflare Pages project with the transferred repository.

#### `The repository cannot be accessed, this may cause deployments to fail.`

You may have excluded this repository from your installation's repository access settings. Go to your GitHub installation settings:

- `https://github.com/settings/installations` for individual accounts
- `https://github.com/organizations/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME>/settings/installations` for organizational accounts

Click **Configure** on the Cloudflare Pages application. Under **Repository access**, ensure that the repository associated with your Cloudflare Pages project is included in the list.

#### `There is an internal issue with your Cloudflare Pages Git installation.`

This is an internal error in the Cloudflare Pages SCM system. You can attempt to [reinstall your Git installation](/pages/configuration/git-integration/#reinstall-a-git-installation), but if the issue persists, [contact support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).

#### `GitHub/GitLab is having an incident and push events to Cloudflare are operating in a degraded state. Check their status page for more details.`

This indicates that GitHub or GitLab may be experiencing an incident affecting push events to Cloudflare. It is recommended to monitor their status page ([GitHub](https://www.githubstatus.com/), [GitLab](https://status.gitlab.com/)) for updates and try deploying again later.
