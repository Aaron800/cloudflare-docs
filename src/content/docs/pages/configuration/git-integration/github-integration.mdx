Cloudflare supports connecting Cloudflare Pages to your GitHub repositories, and will automatically deploy your code everytime you push a change to a branch.

## Features

Beyond automatic deployments, the Cloudflare GitHub integration lets you monitor, manage, and preview deployments directly in GitHub, keeping you informed without leaving your workflow.

### Custom branches

Suppose you have a custom Git workflow that uses specific branches to represent your project's production build. In that case, you can specify a custom branch when creating (or managing an existing) project in the Pages dashboard by going to **Settings** > **Builds** > **Branch control**. To change the production branch, click the **Production branch** dropdown menu and choose any other branch.

You can also use [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) to preview how the new version of your project looks before merging into `production`. In addition, Pages allows you to configure which of your preview branches are built and deployed by using [branch build controls](/pages/configuration/branch-build-controls/).

To configure this in your Pages project go to **Settings** > **Builds** > **Branch control** and select **Custom branches**. Here you can specify branches you wish to include and exclude from automatic deployments in the provided configuration fields. To learn more refer to the [branch build controls](/pages/configuration/branch-build-controls/) documentation.

### Preview URLs

Every time you open a new pull request on your GitHub repository, Cloudflare Pages will create a unique preview URL, which will stay updated as you continue to push new commits to the branch. Note that this feature applies only to pull requests originating from the same repository. Learn more in [Preview Deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/).

### Skipping a build via a commit message

Without any configuration required, you can choose to skip a deployment on an adhoc basis. By adding the `[CI Skip]`, `[CI-Skip]`, `[Skip CI]`, `[Skip-CI]`, or `[CF-Pages-Skip]` flag as a prefix in your commit message, and Pages will omit that deployment. The prefixes are not case sensitive.

### Check runs

If you have one or multiple projects connected to a repository (i.e. a [monorepo](/pages/configuration/monorepos/)), you can check on the status of each build within GitHub via [GitHub check runs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks#checks).

You can see the checks by selecting on the status icon next to a commit within your GitHub repository. In the example below, you can select the green check mark to see the results of the check run.

Check runs will appear like the following in your repository.

If a build skips for any reason (i.e. CI Skip, build watch paths, or branch deployment controls), the check run/commit status will not appear.

## Managing access

You can deploy projects to Cloudflare Workers from your open-source team, company, or side project on GitHub using the [Cloudflare Workers & Pages GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/cloudflare-workers-and-pages).

### Organizational access

You can deploy projects to Cloudflare Pages from your open-source team, company, or side project on both GitHub and GitLab.

When authorizing Cloudflare Pages to access a GitHub account, you can specify access to your individual account or an organization that you belong to on GitHub. In order to be able to add the Cloudflare Pages installation to that organization, your user account must be an owner or have the appropriate role within the organization (that is, the GitHub Apps Manager role). More information on these roles can be seen on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#github-app-managers).

:::caution[GitHub security consideration]

A GitHub account should only point to one Cloudflare account, however, this is not enforced. If you are setting up Cloudflare with GitHub for your organization, Cloudflare recommends that you limit the scope of the application to only the repositories you intend to build with Pages at the time that you set up your project. You can modify these permissions as you build more applications.

### Removing access

You can remove Cloudflare Pages' access to your GitHub repository or account by viewing the [Applications page](https://github.com/settings/installations) on GitHub (if you're in an organization, select Switch settings context to access your GitHub organization settings) or going to [manage Git installation](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/#managing-a-git-installation) on the dashboard. The GitHub App is named Cloudflare Workers and Pages, and it is shared between Workers and Pages projects.

To remove access to an individual GitHub repository, you can navigate to **Repository access**. Select the **Only select repositories** option, and configure which repositories you would like Cloudflare to have access to.

To remove Cloudflare Workers and Pages access to your entire Git account, you can navigate to **Uninstall "Cloudflare Workers and Pages"**, then select **Uninstall**. Removing access to the Cloudflare Workers and Pages app will revoke Cloudflare's access to _all repositories_ from that GitHub account. If you want to only disable automatic builds and deployments, follow the [Disable Automatic Deployments](/pages/configuration/git-integration/#disable-automatic-deployments) instructions.

Note that removing access to GitHub will disable new builds for Workers and Pages project that were connected to those repositories, though the last build of your project will continue to be hosted via Cloudflare Workers.

### Reinstall a Git installation

When encountering Git integration related issues, one potential troubleshooting step is attempting to uninstall and reinstall the GitHub application associated with the Cloudflare Pages installation. The process for each Git provider is provided below.

1. Go to the installation settings page on GitHub:
   - Navigate to **Settings > Builds** for the Pages project and click **Manage** under Git Repository.
   - Alternatively, visit these links to find the Cloudflare Workers and Pages installation and click **Configure**:

|                  |                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Individual**   | `https://github.com/settings/installations`                                        |
| **Organization** | `https://github.com/organizations/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME>/settings/installations` |

2. In the Cloudflare Workers and Pages GitHub App settings page, navigate to **Uninstall "Cloudflare Workers and Pages"** and select **Uninstall**.
3. Go back to the [**Workers & Pages** overview](https://dash.cloudflare.com) page. Click **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**
4. Click the **+ Add account** button, click the GitHub account you want to add, and then click **Install & Authorize**.
5. You should be redirected to the create project page with your GitHub account or organization in the account list.
6. Attempt to make a new deployment with your project which was previously broken.
