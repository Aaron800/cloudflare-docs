This guide teaches you how to investigate build errors and troubleshoot common errors within the Workers Build's build and deployment process.

## Investigate Build Errors and Retry

Workers Builds provides build logs for each build. To view a Worker's build history, go to **Worker project** > **Deployments** > **View Build History** (located at the bottom of the Deployments tab), then select a build to access its details.

To retry a build, click **•••** next to the desired build in the Build History page and select **Retry build**, or use the **Retry build** button on the Build Details page.

## Known Issues or Limitations

Here are some known issues and limitations of Workers Builds to keep in mind while using the feature and tips on how to resolve them.

### Workers Name Requirement

`✘ [ERROR] The name in your wrangler.toml file (<Worker name>) must match the name of your Worker. Please update the name field in your wrangler.toml file.`

When connecting a Git repository to your Workers project, the specified name for the Worker on the Cloudflare dashboard must match the `name` argument in the wrangler.toml file located in the specified root directory. If it doesn't match, please update the name field in your wrangler.toml file to match the name of the Worker on the dashboard.

The build system uses the `name` argument in the wrangler.toml to determine which Worker to deploy to Cloudflare's global network. This requirement ensures consistency between the Worker's name on the dashboard and the deployed Worker.

:::note
This does not apply to [Wrangler Environments](/workers/wrangler/environments/) if the Worker name before the `-<env_name>` suffix matches the name in wrangler.toml.

For example, a Worker named `my-worker-staging` on the dashboard can be deployed from a repository that contains a wrangler.toml with the arguemnts `name = my-worker` and `[env.staging]` using the deploy command `npx wrangler deploy --env staging`.

### Missing Wrangler.toml

`✘ [ERROR] Missing entry-point: The entry-point should be specified via the command line (e.g. wrangler deploy path/to/script) or the main config field.`

If you see this error, a wrangler.toml is likely missing from the root directory. Navigate to **Settings** > **Build** > **Build Configuration** to update the root directory, or add a [wrangler.toml](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to the specified directory.

### Incorrect Account_id

`Could not route to /client/v4/accounts/<Account ID>/workers/services/<Worker name>, perhaps your object identifier is invalid? [code: 7003]`

If you see this error, the wrangler.toml likely has an `account_id` for a different account. Remove the `account_id` argument or update it with your account's `account_id`, available in **Workers & Pages Overview** under **Account Details**.

### Stale API Token

`	Failed: The build token selected for this build has been deleted or rolled and cannot be used for this build. Please update your build token in the Worker Builds settings and retry the build.`

The API Token dropdown in Build Configuration settings may show stale tokens that were edited, deleted, or rolled. If you encounter an error due to a stale token, create a new API Token and select it for the build.

### Build Timed Out

`Build was timed out`

There is a maximum build duration of 20 minutes. If a build exceeds this time, then the build will be terminated and the above error log is shown. For more details, see [Workers Builds limits](/workers/ci-cd/builds/limits-and-pricing/).

### Git Integration Issues

If you are running into errors associated with your Git integration, you can try removing access to your GitHub or GitLab integration from Cloudflare, then reinstalling the Git integration.
