Cloudflare supports connecting your [GitHub](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/) and [GitLab](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/) repository to your Cloudflare Worker, and will automatically deploy your code everytime you push a change to a selected branch.

Adding a Git integration also lets you monitor build statuses directly in your Git provider using [check runs](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/#check-run) or [commit statuses](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#commit-status), allowing you to manage deployments without leaving your workflow.

## Supported Git Providers

Cloudflare supports the following Git providers:

- GitHub
  - [GitHub Free](https://github.com/pricing)
  - [GitHub Team](https://github.com/pricing)
  - [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://github.com/pricing)
  - [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server) (supported with [GitHub Actions](/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/))
- GitLab
  - [GitLab Free](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  - [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  - [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  - [GitLab Enterprise](https://about.gitlab.com/enterprise/)
  - [Self-Managed GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) (supported with [GitLab CI/CD](/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/gitlab-cicd/))

If you use a different Git provider (e.g. Bitbucket), you can use an [external CI/CD provider](/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/index/) and deploy using [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy).

## Adding Git Integration

Workers Builds provides direct integration with GitHub and GitLab accounts, including both individual and organization accounts, that are _not_ self-hosted.

If you don't have a Git account linked to your Cloudflare account, you'll be prompted to set up an installation to GitHub or GitLab when [connecting a repository](/workers/ci-cd/builds/#get-started) for the first time, or when adding a new Git account. Follow the prompts and authorize the Cloudflare Git integration.

You can check the below pages to see if your Git integration has been installed:

- [GitHub Applications page](https://github.com/settings/installations) (if you're in an organization, select **Switch settings context** to access your GitHub organization settings)
- [GitLab Authorized Applications page](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications)

For details on providing access to organization accounts, see [GitHub Organizational Access](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/#organizational-access) and [GitLab Organizational Access](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#organizational-access).

## Managing Git Integration

You can manage the Git installation associated with your repository connection by navigating to the Worker, then going to **Settings** > **Builds** and selecting **Manage** under **Git Repository**.

This can be useful for managing repository access or troubleshooting installation issues by reinstalling. For more details, see the [GitHub](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration) and [GitLab](/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration) guides for how to manage your installation.
